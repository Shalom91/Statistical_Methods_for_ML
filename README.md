# LESSONS FROM THE BOOK: Statistical Methods for Machine Learning by Jason Brownlee

# BOOK STRUCTURE
-  **Part 1: Statistics.** Provides a gentle introduction to the field of statistics, the relationship
to machine learning, and the importance that statistical methods have when working
through a predictive modeling problem.
-  **Part 2: Foundation.** Introduction to descriptive statistics, data visualization, random
numbers, and important findings in statistics such as the law of large numbers and the
central limit theorem.
-  **Part 3: Hypothesis Testing.** Covers statistical hypothesis tests for comparing popula-
tions of samples and the interpretation of tests with p-values and critical values.
-  **Part 4: Resampling.** Covers methods from statistics used to economically use small
samples of data to evaluate predictive models such as k-fold cross-validation and the
bootstrap.
-  **Part 5: Estimation Statistics.** Covers an alternative to hypothesis testing called
estimation statistics, including tolerance intervals, confidence intervals, and prediction
intervals.
-  **Part 6: Nonparametric Methods.** Covers nonparametric statistical hypothesis testing
methods for use when data does not meet the expectations of parametric tests.
